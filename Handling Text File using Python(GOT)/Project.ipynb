We tracked them. They wonâ€™t trouble us no more.\\n\\nROYCE: You donâ€™t think heâ€™ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.\\n\\nWILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.\\n\\nROYCE: Itâ€™s a good thing weâ€™re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter â€¦ If I donâ€™t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I wonâ€™t say it again.\\n\\nROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.\\n\\nWILL: They were here.\\n\\nGARED: See where they went.\\n\\nROYCE: What is it?\\n\\nJON: Go on.

Well done.\\n\\nSANSA: Thank you.\\n\\nSEPTA MORDANE: I love the detail that youâ€™ve managed to get in this corners.\\n\\nNED: And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.\\n\\nJON: Donâ€™t think too much, Bran.\\n\\nROBB: Relax your bow arm.\\n\\nCASSEL: Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills.
